Sentiment Analysis using recurrent neural networks (LSTM)

This project deals with the Sentiment Classification problem where a machine learning model based on LSTM neural network is built for classifying the IMBD reviews as positive and negative.


Dataset Used:
This is a pre-processed dataset of IMDB ratings where the text sentences are converted into numerical vector representations using Google's Word2Vec model
